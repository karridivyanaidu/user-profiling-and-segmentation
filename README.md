# user-profiling-and-segmentation
This project is done by Karri Divya Naidu. This is done as part of my AI/ML internship launched by Bharatversity in collaboration with LaunchPad BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
This is a machine learning solution focused on behaviour-based user grouping and clustering using unsupervised learning techniques.
